## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my Github profile. My name is Ana and I am currently living near Portland, OR.

I have worked in many areas of research related to immunology (kidney/liver transplant, immuno-oncology) as a bench scientist with basic molecular skills related to biobanking, cryopreservation, logistics, clinical trials, and flow cytometry analysis. 

Back in 2018, I started my training as a bioinformatician because I was curious about R language and single cell transcriptomics. I have been working since then with different versions of this technology, including multimodal 10x genomics analysis using scRNAseq, CITE-seq, HTO (hashtag), TCR-seq, some scATAC-seq, and currently, snRNAseq for non-immune cells. I have used different platforms for large computing such as HPCs, AWS, GCP. Most of the analysis tools my team uses are centered around the bioconductor tools and R language for creating reports and reproducible analysis. We also dedicate part of our time testing out larger python libraries to aggregate internal datasets using scverse framework and platforms such as databricks and tileDB (gotta love our data engineers!! 🤓). 

For the past year and a half, I have been mostly working on testing out downstream analysis packages for a project involving a snRNAseq in liver from patients diagnosed with Metabolic-associated liver disease (MASH). We have tested out tools for cell-cell communication, subtype annotation, and pseudobulk differential expression analysis. Our projects are heavily centered around the BIOLOGICAL QUESTION 🧬 and the commercialization of potential drug targets. 

My current project involves a large effort between multiple centers to analyse snRNAseq of a large cohort of patients with MASH. For that reason, I am pulled towards developing analysis pipelines that are able to scale well, proper documentation and reporting, all awhile handling an ongoing wave of batches for analysis throughout the year. 

I love what I do and I would love to get in touch. 🤝

As for personal projects and what I can share with you on github...
