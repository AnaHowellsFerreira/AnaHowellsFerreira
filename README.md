## Hi there 👋

My name is Ana, and I currently live near Portland, OR.

I have extensive experience in various areas of immunology research, including kidney/liver transplant and immuno-oncology. As a bench scientist, I have developed fundamental molecular skills related to biobanking, cryopreservation, logistics, clinical trials, and flow cytometry analysis.

In 2018, I began my training as a bioinformatician, driven by my curiosity about the R language and single-cell transcriptomics. Since then, I have worked with different versions of this technology, including multimodal 10x genomics analysis using scRNAseq, CITE-seq, HTO (hashtag), TCR-seq, some scATAC-seq, and currently, snRNAseq for non-immune cells. I have utilized various platforms for large-scale computing, such as HPCs, AWS, and GCP. Most of the analysis tools my team uses are centered around Bioconductor tools and the R language for creating reports and reproducible analyses. 

Since 2023, I have primarily worked in projects focused on testing downstream analysis packages for snRNAseq analysis of liver samples from patients diagnosed with Metabolic-associated Steatohepatitis (MASH). We have evaluated tools for cell-cell communication, subtype annotation, velocity, GSEA, and pseudobulk differential expression analysis. Our projects are heavily centered around the biological question 🧬 and the commercialization of potential drug targets.

My current project involves a large collaborative effort between multiple centers to analyze snRNAseq data from a large cohort of patients with MASH. Consequently, I am dedicated to developing scalable analysis pipelines that are well-documented and facilitate report generation, all while managing an ongoing wave of batches for analysis throughout the year.

I love what I do and I would love to get in touch. 🤝

As for personal projects and what I can share with you on github...
